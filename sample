Hello, I am David Kao, I made a simple site to introduce myself.
			
I am a web developer with 4-year experiences. I am passionate about website development and design. Furthermore, I am also experienced with some back-end know-how to support my front-end skills. I love to keep a close watch on internet trends, latest web standards and learning new things. 

About my design concepts, my aim is to make everything simple and necessary. Keeping things as simple as possible and intuitive makes the user well experienced.
