Dear xxx,

I would like to apply for the vacancy that you have invited me.
My name is David Kao who has been working as a web designer for 4 years. I am eager to join NVIDIA, therefore, I made a website to introduce myself.

I am a really passionate worker and good at front-end development and design. Furthermore, I am also experienced with some back-end know-how. I would like to tied up myself with latest internet trends and web standards and open my mind to new things.
My design concept is what Leonardo da Vinci once said, ‘simplicity is the ultimate sophistication’. I am dedicated to making my design style simple and necessary in order to make the user an intuitive using experience.
